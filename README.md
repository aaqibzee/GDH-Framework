# GDH-Framework

Game Developemnt Helper Framework.

The idea is to make the  game developer's job easy. 

All the cases that are handled in every game, are going to be covered in this framework. Like screens. (Main Menue, Level Selection, Game Play, Game Over etc.)

The developer's will just neeed to import it in the Unity project and start implementing the Game play instead of having to worry about, things that are common accross 
most of the projects. 

# Technologies
